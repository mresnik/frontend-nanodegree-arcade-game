# Frontend Nanodegree Arcade Game Project

This is the 3rd submitted project in the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree. It is a "Classic Arcade Game Clone" based on Frogger. The object of the
game is to cross the road without being hit by any of the bugs (enemies) as they pass by.

## Getting Started

To run the game simply open the index.html file in your browser.

## Playing The Game

Use the up, down, left and right arrow keys to move the player icon across the road while trying to avoid the enemy bugs. Should you "collide"
with a bug you will be returned to the starting point. Cross all the way across without a collision to get to the river and you win! You will
immediately be returned to the starting point so that you can play again.
